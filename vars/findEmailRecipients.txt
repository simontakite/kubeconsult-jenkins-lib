Determines the email recipients:
For branches that are considered unstable (all except for 'master' and 'develop') only the Git author is returned
(if present).
Otherwise, the default recipients (passed as parameter) and git author are returned.

Git author can be contained in default recipients.

Example:

findEmailRecipients('a@b.cd,123@xy.z')

Returns a comma-separated list of email addresses, depending on the branch: the git author (if present) for unstable
branches. Otherwise the default recipients passed as parameter.
