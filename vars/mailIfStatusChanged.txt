Provides the functionality of the Jenkins Post-build Action "E-mail Notification" known from freestyle projects.
That is, it sends an email when the build status is `FAILED`, and (after failed builds) when the build is back to normal.

Example:
mailIfStatusChanged('a@b.cd,123@xy.z')

Sends the email (if necessary) to the string passed. Expects a comma-separated list of email addresses.
